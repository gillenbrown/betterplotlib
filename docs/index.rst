betterplotlib
===========================================

Betterplotlib is a Python library that is designed to make plotting with matplotlib
easier, and results in prettier plots. It isn't a replacement for either matplotlib
itself or other packages like Seaborn. Betterplotlib adds some sugar behind the scenes
to make the default matplotlib plots look much nicer, and adds some convenience functions
to make some tricky things much easier. You can use the exact same syntax with
betterplotlib as you can with matplotlib, making it a very easy package to use if
you're familiar with matplotlib.
