    Create a contour plot with scatter points in the sparse regions.

    When a dataset is large, plotting a scatterplot is often really hard to 
    understand, due to many points overlapping and the high density of points
    overall. A contour or hexbin plot solves many of these problems, but these
    still have the disadvantage of making outliers less obvious. A simple 
    solution is to plot contours in the dense regions, while plotting
    individual points where the density is low. That is what this function does.

    Here's how this works under the hood. Skip this paragraph if you don't 
    care; it won't affect how you use this. This function uses the numpy 
    2D histogram function to create an array representing the density in each
    region. If no binning info is specified by the user, the Freedman-Diaconis
    algorithm is used in both dimensions to find the ideal bin size for the 
    data. First, an opaque filled contour is plotted, then the contour lines
    are put on top. Then the outermost contour is made into a matplotlib
    path object, which lets us check which of the points are outside of this
    contour. Only the points that are outside are plotted.

    The parameters of this function are more complicated than others in 
    betterplotlib and are somewhat arbitrary, so please read the info below 
    carefully. The examples should make things more clear also.

    :param xs: list of x values of your data
    :type xs: list
    :param ys: list of y values of your data
    :type ys: list
    :param fill_cmap: Colormap that will fill the opaque contours. Defaults to 
                      "white", which is just a solid white fill. You can pass 
                      any name of a matplotlib colormap, as well as some 
                      options I have created. "background_grey" gives a solid 
                      fill that is the same color as the make_ax_dark() 
                      background. "modified_greys" is a colormap that starts 
                      at the "background_grey" color, then transitions to black. 
    :type fill_cmap: str
    :param bin_size: Size of the bins used in the 2D histogram. This is kind
                     of an arbitraty parameter. The code will guess a value for
                     this if none is passed in, but this value isn't always 
                     good. A smaller value gives noisier contours. A value that
                     is too large will lead to "chunky" contours. Adjust this
                     until your contours look good to your eye. That's the best
                     way to pick a value for this parameter.
    :type bin_size: float
    :param min_level: This is another arbitrary parameter that determines how
                      high the density of points needs to be before the outer
                      contour is drawn. The higher the value, the more points
                      will be outside the last contour. Again, adjust this 
                      until it looks good to your eye. The default parameter 
                      choice will generally be okay, though. Also note that if
                      you want to specify the levels yourself, use the `levels`
                      keyword.

                         you want to specify the levels yourself, use the

                           in a dictionary. This is because we have to separate
                           the kwargs that go to the scatter function from the
                           ones that go to the contour function.

    Examples

    First, we'll show why this plot is useful. This won't use any of the 
    fancy settings, other than `bin_size`, which is used to make the contours
    look nicer. 

    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        import betterplotlib as bpl

        bpl.default_style()

        xs = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000)])
        ys = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000)])

        fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=[10, 5])

        bpl.scatter(xs, ys, ax=ax1)
        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3, ax=ax2)

    The scatter plot is okay, but the contour makes things easier to see. 

    We'll now mess with some of the other parameters. This plot shows how the 
    `bin_size` parameter changes things. 

    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        import betterplotlib as bpl

        bpl.default_style()

        xs = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000)])
        ys = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000)])

        fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=[15, 5])

        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.1, ax=ax1)
        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.2, ax=ax2)
        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.5, ax=ax3)

    You can see how small values of `bin_size` lead to more noisy contours. 
    The code will attempt to choose its own value of `bin_size` if nothing is
    specified, but it's normally not a very good choice.

    For a given value of `bin_size`, changing `min_level` adjusts the height 
    at which the first contours are drawn.

    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        import betterplotlib as bpl

        bpl.default_style()

        xs = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000)])
        ys = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000)])

        fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=[15, 5])

        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3, min_level=2, ax=ax1)
        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3, min_level=15, ax=ax2)
        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3, min_level=50, ax=ax3)

    The code sets `min_level = 5` if you don't set it.

    As expected, `num_contours` adjusts the number of contors drawn. 

    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        import betterplotlib as bpl

        bpl.default_style()

        xs = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000)])
        ys = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                             np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000)])

        fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=[15, 5])

        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3, num_contours=2, ax=ax1)
        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3, num_contours=5, ax=ax2)
        bpl.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3, num_contours=10, ax=ax3)

    Now we can mess with the fun stuff, which is the `fill_cmap` param and the
    kwargs that get passed to the `scatter` and `contour` function calls. 
    There is a lot of stuff going on here, just for demonstration purposes. 
    Note that the code has some default parameters that it will choose if you
    don't specify anything.
