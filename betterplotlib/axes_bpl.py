        Create a contour plot with scatter points in the sparse regions.

        When a dataset is large, plotting a scatterplot is often really hard to
        understand, due to many points overlapping and the high density of
        points overall. A contour or hexbin plot solves many of these problems,
        but these still have the disadvantage of making outliers less obvious.
        A simple solution is to plot contours in the dense regions, while
        plotting individual points where the density is low. That is what
        this function does.

        Here's how this works under the hood. Skip this paragraph if you don't
        care; it won't affect how you use this. This function uses the numpy
        2D histogram function to create an array representing the density in
        each region. If no binning info is specified by the user, the
        Freedman-Diaconis algorithm is used in both dimensions to find the
        ideal bin size for the data. First, an opaque filled contour is
        plotted, then the contour lines are put on top. Then the outermost
        contour is made into a matplotlib path object, which lets us
        check which of the points are outside of this contour. Only the points
        that are outside are plotted.

        :param xs: list of x values
        :type xs: list, ndarray
        :param ys: list of y values
        :type ys: list, ndarray
        :param bin_size: Bin size to use for the underlying 2D histogram. This
                         can either be a scalar, in which case the bin size will
                         be the same in both the x dimensions, or else a two
                         element list, where the first element will be the
                         bin size in the x dimension, and the second will be
                         the bin size in the y dimension.
        :type bin_size: int, float, list
        :param percent_levels: A list describing the levels of the contours that
                               will be drawn. Each value in this list contains
                               a float between zero and 1 (inclusive) that
                               describes how much of that data will be enclosed
                               by a contour. So if you pass [0.25, 0.5, 0.75],
                               there will be three contours drawn, that enclose
                               25%, 50%, and 75% of the data. If this is not
                               passed in, the default is
                               [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95].
        :type percent_levels: float, list
        :param smoothing: Optional parameter that will allow the contours to be
                          smoothed. Pass in a nonzero value, which will be the
                          standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel use to smooth
                          the histogram. When using this, often choosing smaller
                          bin sizes is advantageous to make a less grainy plot.
                          Has the same format as padding and bin_size, so different
                          smoothing kernels are possible in the x and y directions.
        :type smoothing: int, float, list
        :param weights: A list containing weights for each data point. If these
                        are not passed, all data points will be weighted
                        equally.
        :type weights: list, np.ndarray
        :param labels: Whether or not to label the individual contour lines
                       with their percentage level.
        :type labels: bool
        :param fill_cmap: The colormap used for the filled regions. Can be
                          a strong with any named matplotlib colormap or a
                          colormap object. In addition, there are some special
                          strings that can be used. "white", which is just a
                          solid white fill, is the default.  "background_grey"
                          gives a solid fill that is the same color as the
                          make_ax_dark() background. "modified_greys" is a
                          colormap that starts at the "background_grey" color,
                          then transitions to black.
        :type fill_cmap: str, matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap
        :param scatter_kwargs: Dictionary of additional parameters that will be
                               passed to the underlying matplotlib scatter
                               function used for points in the outer regions.

        :param contourf_kwargs: Dictionary of additional parameters that will be

        Examples

        First, we'll show why this plot is useful. This won't use any of the
        fancy settings, other than `bin_size`, which is used to make the
        contours look nicer.

        .. plot::
            :include-source:

            import numpy as np
            import betterplotlib as bpl

            bpl.set_style()

            xs = np.concatenate(
                [
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                ]
            )
            ys = np.concatenate(
                [
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 100000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 100000),
                ]
            )

            fig, (ax1, ax2) = bpl.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=[10, 5])

            ax1.scatter(xs, ys)
            ax2.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3)

        The scatter plot is okay, but the contour makes things easier to see.

        We'll now mess with some of the other parameters. This plot shows how
        the  `bin_size` parameter changes things.

        .. plot::
            :include-source:

            import numpy as np
            import betterplotlib as bpl

            bpl.set_style()

            xs = np.concatenate(
                [
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 10000),
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000),
                ]
            )
            ys = np.concatenate(
                [
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 10000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 10000),
                ]
            )

            fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = bpl.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=[15, 5])

            ax1.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.2)
            ax2.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.3)
            ax3.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.5)

        You can see how small values of `bin_size` lead to more noisy contours.
        The code will attempt to choose its own value of `bin_size` if nothing
        is specified, but it's normally not a very good choice.

        Adjusting the smoothing is often the better way to control the
        noise.

        .. plot::
            :include-source:

            import numpy as np
            import betterplotlib as bpl

            bpl.set_style()

            xs = np.concatenate(
                [
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 10000),
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000),
                ]
            )
            ys = np.concatenate(
                [
                    np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 10000),
                    np.random.normal(3, 1, 10000),
                ]
            )

            fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = bpl.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=[15, 5])

            ax1.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.1, smoothing=0.1)
            ax2.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.1, smoothing=0.2)
            ax3.contour_scatter(xs, ys, bin_size=0.1, smoothing=0.3)

        The weights behave exactly the same as they do in the other density
        contour functions. Here we just have 4 points, but with different
        weights. We also show the different smoothing for different axes, and
        the labels.

        .. plot::
            :include-source:

            import betterplotlib as bpl

            bpl.set_style()

            xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
            ys = [1, 2, 3, 4]
            weights = [1, 2, 3, 4]
            bpl.contour_scatter(
                xs,
                ys,
                weights=weights,
                bin_size=0.01,
                smoothing=[0.8, 0.3],
                fill_cmap="Blues",
                labels=True,
                contour_kwargs={"colors": "k"},
            )
            bpl.equal_scale()

        Now we can mess with the fun stuff, which is the `fill_cmap` param and
        the kwargs that get passed to the `scatter`, `contour`, and `contourf`
        function calls. There is a lot of stuff going on here, just for
        demonstration purposes. Note that the code has some default parameters
        that it will choose if you don't specify anything.

        scaling of the other. If you want a simple linear or log scale, use the
        `twin_axis_simple` function. This one will create a new axis that is
        an arbitrary scale.

        :param axis: Whether the new axis labels will be on the "x" or "y" axis.
                     If "x" is chosen this will place the markers on the top
                     botder of the plot, while "y" will place the values on the
                     left border of the plot. "x" and "y" are the only
                     allowed values.

                          will be ignored.

            def square(x):
                return x**2

            ax.twin_axis("x", [0, 10, 100, 400, 1000], "$x^3$", cubed)

        Note that we had to be careful with floating point errors when one of
        the markers we want is exactly on the edge. Make the borders slightly
        larger to ensure that all labels fit on the plot.

        There are two ways to give the funtion that transforms the values from
        one axis to the other. The parameter `old_to_new_func` (used as the
        last parameter in the plot above) takes values on the original axis and
        transforms them to values on the newly created axis. However, the
        parameter `new_to_old_func` does the inverse, taking values on the
        new axis and transforming them to the currently existing one. Only one
        of these two parameters can be provided. Identical plots can be created
        with either function, but due to specifics of the implementation, using
        the `new_to_old_func` parameter is slightly more computationally
        efficient. Here's an example of an identical plot to the first created
        with `new_to_old_func` instead.


        .. plot::
            :include-source:

            import numpy as np
            import betterplotlib as bpl

            bpl.set_style()

            def cube_root(x):
                return x ** (1.0 / 3.0)

            fig, ax = bpl.subplots(figsize=[5, 5], tight_layout=True)
            ax.set_limits(0, 10, 0, 10.0001)  # to avoid floating point errors
            ax.add_labels("x", "y")
            ax.twin_axis("y", [0, 10, 30, 60, 100], "$y^2$", new_to_old_func=np.sqrt)
            ax.twin_axis(
                "x", [0, 10, 100, 400, 1000], "$x^3$", new_to_old_func=cube_root
            )

        This function will ignore values for the ticks that are outside the
        limits of the plot. The following plot isn't the most useful, since
        it could be done with the `axis_twin_simple`, but it gets the idea
        across.
